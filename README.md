## Love bioinformatics and medicine
... and hamsters üêπ

PhD student at TUM, Germany. 

Projects:
- [FedProt](https://github.com/Freddsle/FedProt) - privacy-preserving multi-center differential protein abundance analysis tool.
- [UnPaSt](https://github.com/ozolotareva/unpast) - a novel method for unsupervised patient stratification.

I graduated from [the Bioinformatics Institute](https://bioinf.me/en) "Bioinformatics for biologists" program in 2022.  
- My project - [Age in gene regulatory networks](https://github.com/Freddsle/age_patterns). 
We explored if gene interaction preference for genes with similar age holds in GRNs).

During studying, I did several projects:
- [Vagus](https://github.com/Freddsle/Vagus) ‚Äî FASTQC-like FASTQ quality analyzer tool (Python)
- [ML Telegram Bot for Blindness Detection](https://github.com/Freddsle/ML_Blindness_Detection) (Python)
- Practice with principal component analysis and linear models for differential protein expression (R). [Link](https://github.com/Freddsle/BI_Stat_2021/tree/main/mouse_project).

Also, I have experience in molecular biology and protein engineering.
